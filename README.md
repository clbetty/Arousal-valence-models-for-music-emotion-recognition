# Arousal-valence-models-for-music-emotion-recognition
In this project we executed 6 pre-trained ML algorithms to gather arousal and valence predictions of a collection of audio recordings, and compared their performance also together with the Spotify annotations taking as ground-truth our manual annotations. 

The project consisted in 3 different steps:
1. Annotation: we annotated a chunk of 300 audio recordings. Instead of giving absolute arousal and valence values, the process consisted in listening to pairs of songs and comparing which song had a higher arousal and a higher valence. 
2. Computing model predictions: run ComputeModelPredictions.ipynb. 
3. Evaluation: run Evaluation.ipynb
